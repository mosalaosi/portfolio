# portfolio description
This repo contains python projects and code from exam questions I have taken from University of Michigan's Python programming specialization-https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python

It also contains Lab activities from Google's Cybersecurity Certification program on Coursera-https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity
These are uploaded in pdf and docx file formats. 

Other coding projects in this repository are those I learned from free-code-camp's Scientific Computing with Python Course and from the vast internet.

All files can be found in the above folder named cybersecurity portfolios.
